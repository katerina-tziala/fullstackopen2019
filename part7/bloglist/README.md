Bloglist App<br/>
</h1>

The *BlogList App* is a simple React App, which allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet. For each listed blog the app saves the author, the title, the url, and the amount of upvotes from users of the application.

The *BlogList App* consists of two parts:

* [**backend**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part7/bloglist/backend)**:** This folder contains the code of the backend side of the app. 

* [**frontend**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part7/bloglist/frontend)**:** This folder contains the code of the frontend side of the app.






<h3>Running the App</h3>

To run the app locally, both parts of the app (backend and frontend) should run in parallel (different terminals). Follow the instructions in the *README* file, located in the root folder of each part, to compile and run the app locally.

**Note:** Make sure that you create a user according to the *README* file in [**backend**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part7/bloglist/backend) folder and you will use the credentials to login according to the *README* file in [**frontend**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part7/bloglist/frontend) folder.
