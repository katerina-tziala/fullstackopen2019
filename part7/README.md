<br/>Part 7: React Router, Styling App with CSS and Webpack<br/>
</h2>

The seventh part of the course touches on several different themes. It starts with React-Router, which helps in dividing an application into different views that are shown based on the URL in the browser's address bar. Next, it presents a few more ways to add CSS-styles to React applications. After this, it presents how Webpack works and how we can use it to configure the applications ourselves.
