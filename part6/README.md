## Exercises of Part 6

This directory contains the series of exercises for *Part 6*. In this part two applications were developed:

- [**unicafe_redux**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part6/unicafe_redux)**:** The *Unicafe App*, a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

- [**anecdotes_redux**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part6/anecdotes_redux)**:** The *Anecdotes App*, which displays anecdotes from the world of software engineering, where users can display random anecdotes and vote the displayed ones.

## Running the Apps

For each one of the developed apps follow the instructions in the ***README** file, located in the root directory of each app, to compile and run the app locally.
