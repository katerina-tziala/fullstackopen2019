  Full Stack Open 2019 - University of Helsinki<br/><br/>Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development<br/>
</h1>

The orientation of this course is JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.<br/>
The course covers development, testing, configuration, environment management, and additionally:

- the use of Redux, for managing the state of React-applications
- the use of MongoDB, for storing the applicationâ€™s data
- the use of GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs

The structure of this repository is accordingly to the structure of the course. For each part there is a directory that contains the description of the part and the respective exercises. The following list is an overview of the course, whilst the *documentation_images* directory contains all the images used in the README files of this repository.

<br/>Part 2: Communicating with Server<br/>
</h2>

This part builds up the knowledge on React-library. Firstly, it presents how to render a data collection, like a list of names, on the screen. After this, it deals with how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, the focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, it provides a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to React applications.

<ol type="A">
  <li>Rendering a collection, modules</li>
  <li>Forms</li>
  <li>Getting data from Server</li>
  <li>Altering data in Server</li>

<br/>Part 3: Programming a Server with NodeJS and Express<br/>
</h2>

In this part the focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. It covers the implementation of a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data are stored in a MongoDB database. Last but not least, a fully developed app is being deployed to the internet, on the
[**Heroku Platform**](https://www.heroku.com/platform).

***Sections of Part 3:***

  <li>Node.js and Express</li>
  <li>Deploying App to Internet</li>
  <li>Saving data to MongoDB</li>
  <li>Validation and ESLint</li>
</ol>

The code of the developed App that was deployed on Heroku can be found in [**phonebook_app repository**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/phonebook_app), whilst the app can be accessed here:
[**PhoneBook App**](https://phonebook-app-kt.herokuapp.com/).
