<br/>Part 2: Communicating with Server<br/>
</h2>

This part builds up the knowledge on React-library. Firstly, it presents how to render a data collection, like a list of names, on the screen. After this, it deals with how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, the focus shifts towards fetching and handling data, stored in a remote backend server, with JavaScript in the client's browser (frontend). Lastly, it provides a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to React applications.
