# Part 2: Communicating with Server

This part builds up the knowledge on React-library. Firstly, it presents how to render a data collection, like a list of names, on the screen. After this, it deals with how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, the focus shifts towards fetching and handling data, stored in a remote backend server, with JavaScript in the client's browser (frontend). Lastly, it provides a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to React applications.

## Exercises of Part 2

This directory contains the series of exercises for *Part 2*. In this part three applications were developed:

- [**courseinfo**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part2/courseinfo)**:** The *CourseInfo App*, which displays information for a course.

- [**dataforcountries**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part2/dataforcountries)**:** The *DataForCountries App*, which displays information for various countries.

- [**phonebook**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/fullstackopen2019/tree/master/part2/phonebook)**:** The *PhoneBook App*, a digital phonebook where users can manage and display phonenumbers of desired persons.

## Running the Apps

To compile and run locally the applications developed in this part, follow the instructions in the ***README*** file, located in the root directory of each app.
